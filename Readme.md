# Mini Social Network

An work-in-progress excersize in API production / consumption. Not supposed to be too fancy but we'll see how far it goes.

Basic requirements

- Users can register
- Users can search for each other
- Users can converse

This isn't supposed to be exclusively Ruby on Rails but that is the technology being used for the server at this time.
